/*
Abinary tree where for each node, 
the value of all the nodes in the left subtree is less than the value of the node, 
and the value of all the nodes in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node, 
is called a binary search tree (BST).

NOte: inorder traversal of a BST gives the sorted order of the elements in the BST.
